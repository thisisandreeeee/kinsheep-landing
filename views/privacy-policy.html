<p><strong>4. How do we protect your Information?</strong></p>

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
	Our marketing partners, affiliated companies and other organisations that work for us may have access to the Information.</p>

	<p>In certain circumstances, we may disclose the Information if required by the law or defend others or ourselves against illegal or harmful activities.</p>

Cookies are text files placed on your computer that do not contain any personally identifiable information but they help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. </p>
